## Overridable Fields

The prompt should include clear indicators for fields that users can override to customize their analysis. These overridable fields allow users to:
- Correct inaccurate AI estimates with known building data
- Test sensitivity scenarios with different assumptions
- Accommodate unique building characteristics not captured by standard models

### Building Characteristics (Overridable)
- **yearBuilt**: Override if PLUTO data is incorrect or if major renovations changed building performance
- **numFloors**: Correct if actual floor count differs from PLUTO records  
- **resArea**: Override with actual measured square footage if available
- **unitsRes**: Correct total unit count if different from PLUTO data
- **ptacUnits**: Override if actual PTAC unit count is known (bypasses unit mix calculation)

### Unit Mix Distribution (Overridable)
- **studio**: Number of studio units
- **one_bed**: Number of one-bedroom units  
- **two_bed**: Number of two-bedroom units
- **three_plus**: Number of three+ bedroom units
*(Note: These should auto-update to maintain unitsRes total when modified)*

### Energy Performance Assumptions (Overridable)
- **annualUnitThermsHeatingPTAC**: Per-unit heating consumption (default: 255 therms/year)
- **annualUnitKwhCoolingPTAC**: Per-unit cooling consumption (default: 1,600 kWh/year)

### UI Considerations for Overridable Fields
- Show original/calculated values alongside override inputs
- Use different styling (e.g., italic text) to indicate overridden values
- Include "Reset to Default" options for each override
- Validate override inputs (e.g., unit mix must sum to total units)
- Show impact of overrides on key metrics in real-time
- Include tooltips explaining the significance of each override

## Implementation Notes

This prompt is designed to generate a comprehensive, user-friendly dashboard that:

1. **Presents complex data simply**: Technical calculations are shown with context and explanations
2. **Uses actual variable names**: All variables match the LaTeX documentation exactly
3. **Provides transparency**: Shows data sources and whether values are verified or AI-estimated
4. **Enables decision-making**: Clear financial metrics and scenario analysis
5. **Maintains accuracy**: All formulas and methodologies align with the technical documentation

## Usage

When implementing this prompt:
1. Replace bracketed placeholders with actual calculated values
2. Ensure all variable names match those in the codebase
3. Include hover tooltips for technical terms
4. Make expandable sections actually collapsible
5. Use charts/graphs where appropriate (especially for time-series data)
6. Maintain consistent number formatting throughout

## Visual Design Recommendations

- Use a clean, modern design with plenty of whitespace
- Implement a tab navigation that's easy to use
- Use icons to make sections more scannable
- Include a summary card at the top of each tab
- Use green/red color coding for positive/negative values
- Make the interface responsive for different screen sizes
